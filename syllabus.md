## Course description: what is this course about?

What is politics?

Who has political power and why?

Who gets to speak and what happens when they are not heard?

What are the different ways to set up political systems and government?

What is democracy and is it the best political system?

What do ideas like capitalism, socialism, equality or freedom mean in
politics?

How must politics transform to address reconciliation, racism, gender,
sexualities, ableism, settler colonialism, and fundamentalism and their
impact on everyday life?

Why do people and states fight each other?

Should international rules govern the Internet, pandemic responses,
refugee policies, or Indigenous-settler treaties?

Should the environment be a political priority and why is it not?

Together, we will consider what politics is, worldviews which explain
our political world, the different political systems and institutions,
and important global issues.

We provide an exciting opportunity to understand and challenge political
ideas; discuss varied and critical political issues; learn reading,
discussion & writing skills; and understand our world.

We look forward to having YOU in our class and pursuing a journey of
learning!

## Course objectives: what will you learn about in this course?

(1) We start with learning about some key concepts. From there, we focus
    primarily on global politics, including discussion about war,
    international economies, issues related to the environment and
    pandemics. In the second term, we will consider ideas, arguments,
    theories, and ideologies produced in the history of political
    thought in the West, including power, democracy, freedom, justice,
    liberalism, conservatism, socialism, feminism, and ecologism.

(2) Students will develop the capacity to think about politics
    analytically and critically. In particular, they will acquire and
    strengthen their abilities to: understand and analyze arguments in
    political texts; connect and assess them in light of current
    political debates; and, defend clear positions on potentially
    controversial political issues, such as the obligation to obey the
    law, the nature of justice, the legitimacy of democracy, the nature
    of a free society, the status of the dominant ideologies of our
    time, the value of political participation, and the role of global
    organization in the modern world.

(3) Students will achieve objectives for (1) by engaging in
    lecture-class discussions, watching video lectures, and doing
    readings from the textbook. Students will achieve objective (2) by
    completing a research and outline assignment for the essay, writing
    an argumentative essay, participating in discussions, and completing
    a test and an exam throughout the semester. The discussions and
    writing assignments, along with your reading and lecture attendance,
    will provide the practice needed to succeed in the tests and exams.

- [Concerning "Undocumented Absence" Academic
  Consideration:]{.underline}

  - You do not need to submit a request for academic consideration if
    the EBO deadline cannot be met (self-attestation or otherwise)

  - This is because an extension will be granted automatically, without
    penalty, to Tuesday October 14th, for those experiencing extenuating
    circumstances (e.g., illness, bereavement, etc.) that prevent
    submission on the Due Date of Wednesday October 8^th^.

  - TO BE CLEAR: *this does not mean the EBO is "really" due on* Tuesday
    October 14th. It is due on Wednesday October 8th, but after Tuesday
    October 14^th^ 11:59pm, the EBO is considered late, but we will
    still accept submission until Wednesday October 15th with a late
    penalty of -10% applied

  - Again, a request for academic consideration will not be considered
    if submitting between Wed Oct 8 11:59pm and Wed Oct 15 11:59pm
    because an extension was already granted, and the EBO is now late

  - Per Senate Regulations: "An instructor may deny academic
    consideration relating to the timeframe submission of work where
    there is already flexibility in the submission timeframe (e.g.,
    72-hour submission window). This assessment flexibility must be
    indicated on the course outline"
    (<https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot>)

  - Per Office of the Registrar FAQ "When CAN\'T I use an undocumented
    absence? When flexibility in assessment exists and is clearly stated
    on the course outline, both undocumented absences and academic
    consideration requests with documentation may be denied."
    (<https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot>)

- If you have significant extenuating documented circumstances, you
  should read the Registrar's Academic Consideration page
  <https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html>
  and go through their Student Absence Portal to request such academic
  consideration

- If you have documented grounds for a late submission extension beyond
  October 15th, in that case, you should read the Registrar's Academic
  Consideration page
  <https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html>
  and go through their Student Absence Portal to request such academic
  consideration

    academic consideration

  - Per Office of the Registrar FAQ "When CAN\'T I use an undocumented
    absence? \... Undocumented absences also cannot be used for the
    "designated assessment" in each course."
    (<https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot>)

  - Per Senate regulation "Policy on Academic Consideration --
    Undergraduate Students in First Entry Programs", under "Policy":
    "Instructors may designate one assessment per half-course weight as
    requiring formal supporting documentation. In such cases, the
    instructor must provide the student with another opportunity to
    demonstrate proficiency in the content evaluated by the missed
    assessment within the time frame of the course.", and note that our
    course is a full-year course so each term is 'half-course weight'
    <https://uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/appeals/academic_consideration_Sep24.pdf>)

- Documented Absence Academic Consideration: to request academic
  consideration for your medical, varsity sport, or other documented

constitutes a Scholastic Offence, at the following Web site:

<https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/appeals/scholastic_discipline_undergrad.pdf>

# Zoom Etiquette (for office hours)

1.  Please pay attention to video, microphone and screensharing
    settings. Keep chat rooms and images appropriate for an academic
    setting. Any inappropriate actions, imagery, discussion or chat
    messages may result in your removal from the meeting at my
    discretion. Audio recordings may be available as an alternative to
    synchronous discussion.

2.  Please test all WIFI, video and audio before the meetings. Zoom
    buttons for raising your hand, responding yes and no, asking host to
    adjust speed, requesting a break and more.

3.  Please be conscious of your speaking time and that of others, if you
    are continuing in a manner that is not fair to your peers, I reserve
    the right to intervene and put us back on a more focused discussion.

# Recording synchronous content (office hours or other meetings)

Any remote learning sessions for this course **may** be recorded. The
data captured during these recordings may include your image, voice
recordings, chat logs and personal identifiers (name displayed on the
screen). The recordings may be used for educational purposes related to
this course, including evaluations. The recordings may be disclosed to
other individuals participating in the course for their private or group
study purposes. Please contact the instructor if you have any concerns
related to session recordings. Participants in this course are not
permitted to record the sessions, except where recording is an approved
accommodation, or the participant has the prior written permission of
the instructor.

# Non-medical and medical accommodation

Non-medical absences from class, late essays or assignments, will be
subject to a 10% penalty per day (weekends included). All assignments
must be completed to receive course credit. Further information is found
in the Policy on Accommodation for Medical Illness
(<https://studentservices.uwo.ca/secure/index.cfm>).

Accommodation for medical illness of work worth less than 10% of the
total course grade will require medical documentation. If documentation
is required for either medical or non-medical academic accommodation,
then such documentation must be submitted directly to the appropriate
Faculty Dean\`s office and [not]{.underline} to the instructor. Only the
Dean\`s office can determine if accommodation is warranted.

## Guidelines for Success in Class

Since there seldom are definitive answers to the questions we will be
asking about political power and participation, and much of what you
will learn in this course will be enhanced by the ideas and perspectives
of your colleagues. But for this to work, everyone must participate
fully and constructively. Be mindful of the following points, and you
will be successful:

- Come to all classes having read the assigned readings for that week
  and prepared to participate in discussion. It is useful to remember
  that some week's readings may be more comfortable relevant to your
  research interests than others and focusing on readings that are most
  salient to your interests will ensure maximum usefulness in the
  course.

- Participate in discussions, but do not over-participate. Everyone must
  be given an opportunity to take part in discussions. Constructive
  participation involves the raising of *relevant* points and ideas.
  Online participation will be considered as well in participation
  marks.

- Demonstrate respect for the ideas presented by others at all times.
  This is essential to open discussion and the free exchange of ideas.
  This does not mean that you must agree with others. Informal debate
  will teach you even more about your own position while simultaneously
  exposing you to different viewpoints. Make use of such opportunities,
  but no disrespectful behavior will be tolerated.

## Policy on communication

I strive to be accessible and responsive to student inquiries. However,
repeated or persistent e-mails/texts/phone calls will overload my
capacity to respond to all students equally. As such, I reserve the
right to answer initial questions but forego multiple responses or
inquiries for a 24-hour cool-down period. I also may take longer to
respond to communications during non-working hours, holidays, and
weekends. I appreciate your understanding in this matter.

## Policy on Children in the classroom[^1]

"It is my belief that if we want women in academia, that we should also
expect children to be present in some form. Currently, the university
does not have a formal policy on children in the classroom. The policy
described here is thus, a reflection of my own beliefs and commitments
to student, staff and faculty parents.

All exclusively breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as is
necessary to support the breastfeeding relationship. Because not all
women can pump sufficient milk, and not all babies will take a bottle
reliably, I never want students to feel like they have to choose between
feeding their baby and continuing their education. You and your nursing
baby are welcome in class anytime.

For older children and babies, I understand that minor illnesses and
unforeseen disruptions in childcare often put parents in the position of
having to choose between missing class to stay home with a child and
leaving him or her with someone you or the child does not feel
comfortable with. While this is not meant to be a long-term childcare
solution, occasionally bringing a child to class in order to cover gaps
in care is perfectly acceptable.

I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment
that is respectful of all forms of diversity, including diversity in
parenting status.

In all cases where babies and children come to class, I ask that you sit
close to the door so that if your little one needs special attention and
is disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until
their need has been met. Non-parents in the class, please reserve seats
near the door for your parenting classmates.

Finally, I understand that often the largest barrier to completing your
coursework once you become a parent is the tiredness many parents feel
in the evening once children have finally gone to sleep. The struggles
of balancing school, childcare and often another job are exhausting! I
hope that you will feel comfortable disclosing your student-parent
status to me. This is the first step in my being able to accommodate any
special needs that arise. While I maintain the same high expectations
for all student in my classes regardless of parenting status, I am happy
to problem solve with you in a way that makes you feel supported as you
strive for school-parenting balance. Thank you for the diversity you
bring to our classroom!"

## Policy on non-service animals in the classroom 

Western University established a [Pets and Therapy Animals policy in May
2020](https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/policies_procedures/section1/mapp156.pdf)
that limits the presence of pets in campus buildings. Service and
therapy animals are permitted inside all Western locations, in
accordance with accessibility policies, however animals for
companionship are not allowed.

## Religious/Cultural Observance 

Persons who have religious or cultural observances that coincide with
this class should let the instructor know in writing (by e-mail for
example) by Week 4. I strongly encourage you to honor your cultural and
religious holidays! However, if I do not hear from you by Week 4, I will
assume that you plan to attend all class meetings.

## Point of View

The readings, class lectures, and my comments in class will suggest a
particular point of view. This perspective is my own and does not have
to be yours! I encourage you to disagree with the ideas in the readings
and lectures as well as the perspectives of your colleagues in the
course. Please express yourself! A significant part of a university
education is learning about the complexity of various issues; therefore,
it is important that we listen and respect one another but we do not
have to agree. A richer discussion will occur when a variety of
perspectives are presented in class for discussion.

## Discussion Guidelines[^2]

In our structured and unstructured discussions and dialogues, we also
will have many opportunities to explore some challenging, high-stakes
issues and increase our understanding of different perspectives. Our
conversations may not always be easy; we sometimes will make mistakes in
our speaking and our listening; sometimes we will need patience or
courage or imagination or any number of qualities in combination to
engage our texts, our classmates, and our own ideas and experiences.
Always we will need respect for others. Thus, an important secondary aim
of our course necessarily will be for us to increase our facility with
the sometimes-difficult conversations that arise inside issues of social
inequality as we deepen our understandings of multiple perspectives --
whatever our backgrounds, experiences, or positions.

## Policy on the use of LLMs (AI, ChatGPT, Bard, etc) in the classroom[^3] 

Unless otherwise noted during class activities, you may only use ChatGPT
or any other Generative technology to *aid* or *nuance* your thinking,
communication, and learning; but not to *replace* or *subvert* it. See
the table below for some examples of allowable and non-allowable uses of
Generative technology in this class (NOTE: This is not an exhaustive
list of examples). Generative technology may be used to assist in
assessment throughout the course, if you wish to opt out of the use of
generative technology, please let me know.

How generative technology may be used in assessment:

1\. Pre-assessment - to provide structural or overall feedback before
beginning any grading.

2\. Applying rubric - using the rubric from the course outline to apply
to submitted assignments to assess the degree of compliance before or
during completing any grading.

3\. During assessment - to double-check the veracity of claims being
made about your submission during the assessment of your material.

4\. Post assessment - to find additional examples or instances in your
submissions to assist in providing feedback.

5\. Refining assessment - suggesting forms of constructive criticism,
actionable items, and overarching themes or issues to assist in your
assessment.

6\. Checking for unauthorized AI use, following University guidelines
(and those attached below).

How generative technology will NOT be used in assessment:

No grades will be assigned solely with generative technology at any
point in this course. Assessment will always be done by the
instructor/graders in accordance with the course outlines, because of
the unpredictability and unreliability of current generative technology.

No personal or individual identifiers will ever be included in the
assessment of material by any generative technology.

Reminder: You can also use the Course Info Bot
Do I have to attend each lecture on Tuesdays and tutorial on Thursday each week? 
Yes. 

What is a Blended Class?
As our class is designated Blended, the course is organized as follows:

1) Lecture videos will be posted online on the OWL site before lectures, so you should view Lectures videos in advance of lectures so the lecture discussions, debates, activities, etc., will be more helpful and useful, and you are welcome to pull ahead in the readings and lecture videos, and complimentarily, you can catch up on the core materials if you miss a lecture but do attend lectures!

2) In-person attendance in our lecture and tutorial room will follow a ‘flipped class’ model: we will have questions-and-answers, discussions, activities, debates, etc. based on the lecture videos and current events. Importantly: if you are unwell for any reason, please don't come to the lecture hall at all, focus on getting healthy, and you can always watch the lecture videos while you are getting better or after. Note: exams are based on lectures, lecture videos,  and readings

Where is the Course Outline?
Look in the left hand nav bar in brightspace or access it here http://tiny.cc/1026outline

Where are each Term's Lecture Videos and other Content?
The Lecture videos will be on the POLS 1026 Course Content section. This will also be where links to posted non-textbook readings will be found. The topics for each week's lecture and the readings for those lectures are stated in the Course Outline. 
If there is a problem with the video, such as it's disappeared, dragging, etc., let us know. Videos are either on our site or on YouTube (or both) but we appreciate there can be technology issues, so we appreciate feedback on tech problems so we can help your classmates, as well.

Are there Required Readings?
Yes. The required readings, textbooks, etc., are all in the Course Outline.

Where can I find information about the Mid-Term Test and Final Exam?
On this OWL site and each one will have it's own information section and pages.

Are all Mid-Term Test and Final Exam multiple choice?
Yes.

Is the Mid-Term Test online?
Yes.

Do I have to download ProctorTrack, Proctorio, ProctorEdu, QuestionMark, etc., for the Mid-Term Test?
No. We are not using any proctoring software which will cause computer issues, but also we don't have any way to monitor, etc., so we cannot and do not provide any rectification for computer issues,
When in the Mid-Term Test?
Check the Course Outline and the Mid-Term Info page.

When is the Mid-Term Make-up Test?
Check the Course Outline and the Mid-Term Info page.

Is the Final Exam in-person?
Yes.

When is the Final Exam?
It will be during the Final Exam time period and a date will be released by the Registrar. Note: we will only know the date when the final exam schedule is released by the Registrar.

When is the Make-up Final Exam?
In January 2026. Dates will be posted on the OWL site.

Can I write the Mid-Term Test or Final Exam with a -10% Penalty if I have no grounds from Academic Consideration?
Yes. You don't need to have a reason for missing the Mid-Term or Final Exam, and you simply write the Make-up and -10% will be deducted from your achieved grade, e.g., you got 70% on the Make-up Final Exam, so you'll get 60% (70%-10%) for your Final Exam grade.

What if I have travel plans that conflict with the Mid-Term Test or Final Exam?
These are not grounds for academic consideration for the Mid-Term Test or the Final Exam.

Where can I find information about the Essay assignment?
The Essay information will be posted on  page on the Course Home page and in the Left Menu on the Content page

When are grades released for assignments?
When they are ready and available, we will let you know. See and keep checking th Announcements page to look for updates.
Don't keep emailing us to ask when, or if you alone could have your grade before everyone else as that would be grossly unfair to your classmates.

What is Zoom and why and how do I use it?
We are using Zoom for some of our Office Hours and meetings. "Zoom is a cloud-based solution for video and audio conferencing, collaboration, and online meetings. Your Western Identity is used as your login credentials for Zoom." (Western Technology Services).
Look through UWO's WTS website, which gives instructions about how to install and use Zoom, and other useful tips as well.
How do I reach Zoom technical support?
If you are having trouble, whether on campus or at home, calling the Helpdesk at 519-661-3800 ext. 83800 will put you in touch with an agent who will gladly help you. For more information, visit the Helpdesk Website.

What are the best approaches to doing the Readings?
1. Read the Reading: no notes, etc., JUST get the 'big picture' and the major points of the Reading, etc. — read briskly & keep moving, so you follow the main narrative and points.

2. Watch the Lecture videos to figure out what was important in/emphasized from the Readings.

3. Go back and review the Readings only for what you don't understand, what needs more details/explanations.

These strategies will help you:

— Make more efficient use of your studying time.

— Read with better comprehension.

— Remember what you’ve read.

Another great resource is Active Reading Strategies by Dr. Mike Atkinson, Prof of Psychology:

ACTIVE READING STRATEGIES

The strategies recommended for efficient learning of text material can be divided into three types: Pre-reading, Reading for comprehension, Post-reading.

PRE-READING: LEARN THE HEADINGS AND SUBHEADINGS

— Instead of diving immediately into reading the chapter, spend a few minutes learning the headings and subheadings.

— They tell you the important ideas that will be covered in the chapter.

— In the text they are laid out for you on the first few pages of the book in the table of contents.

— Look at these headings and subheadings, think how they have been ordered, try reciting them from memory, and then write them out on a separate sheet of paper.

READING FOR COMPREHENSION: READ A FEW PAGES AND THEN SUMMARIZE

— Don't try to read most of the chapter in one sitting. It is much easier to learn the material in small chunks.

— Read a few pages carefully and THEN make a summary of the important points. Continue doing this until you have summarized about 10 pages — then take a break.

— You can summarize by highlighting sparingly AND making marginal notes, or by making separate written notes.

— Note that much of the information in psychology comes in the form of arguments.

— Here are some the important kinds of information that are crucial to knowing and understanding an argument: i) definitions of new terms, ii) essential explanations of the specific argument, iii) examples, iv) results of studies.

— If you make separate summary notes, try using point form and keywords.

— This has two advantages: the notes are made more quickly, and they are easier to read.

— As you record key terms and definitions, ALWAYS relate them to the arguments of which they are a part.

POST-READING: TEST YOURSELF

— After actively reading 10 or more pages in the manner described above, try reciting (i.e., recalling from memory) all the important points under each heading and subheading that you have studied.

— This will reinforce the ideas you know and identify those that you need to review.

— Reviewing any study guide questions and relevant old exam questions after you have finished the entire chapter can also be very helpful.

[**OWL
Accessibility**](https://owlhelp.uwo.ca/about/accessibility/index.html)

Web accessibility refers to how easily people with disabilities can
navigate and interact with websites. Disabilities may be physical (such
as blindness, low vision, deafness, or fine motor skills difficulty), or
cognitive (such as dyslexia or attention deficit disorder). People with
disabilities often use assistive technologies to help them navigate the
web. An assistive technology is any device that helps a person with a
disability. Common web assistive technologies include modified mice and
keyboards, screen readers and screen magnifiers. Web accessibility
occurs when websites support web accessibility standards, are compatible
with assistive technologies, and are easy for people to navigate and
understand.

Every attempt has been made to make this course accessible to you.

Necessary conditions for passing this course
Necessary conditions for passing this course or receiving your earned grade: you must write the Exam; (not necessarily passing it, and submit the Essay for the course (not necessarily earn a passing grade on the Essay, but your Essay must be assessed as minimally acceptable effort to complete a proper essay). If you do not meet the aforementioned three conditions, then you will receive a failing grade (not your earned grade based on completed assignments) for the course and not receive credit for this course. Contact the course instructor if you have any questions.

Question: how do I get the bot to summarize the lecture?
Answer: there's too much data to upload all at once into the bot, you can do it yourself by taking the PowerPoint 'File' --> 'export' --> 'download as PDF' then you can put it in any chat bot with the prompt 'use this file to develop 10 multiple choice questions with four options'. 

This chatbot does not have access to the course content, it only has access to the syllabus, and the information provided by the professor. Students need to review the content themselves. Any answers about course content provided by the bot are not from our course content, they are from the general information available to chat GPT.

Question: Are office hours only online or is in-person available as well?
Answer: Dan is in Toronto, so office hours are on Zoom. Nig can meet in person.

Question: Are textbooks mandatory?
Answer: Yes, the textbooks are required.

Question: Can we record the lectures?

Question: Do we get advisory when writing our final essay?
Answer: I’m not entirely sure what this means.

Question: Does one professor write the exam or do both write it together? If the answer is the former, which professor writes the exam?

Question: How relevant is political science in terms of the law field? Would my knowledge of the law world be ahead of a psychology student who’s also looking to apply for law school?
Answer: The bulk of reference letters that Dan writes are for law school. Analytical framework and argumentation are very relevant to law school.

Question: How will I be able to contribute?
Answer: Make sure to come to all of the lectures and tutorial hours. There will be lots of in-class discussion.

Question: I have a class directly before this one completely across campus. Would it be an issue if I was a few minutes late to this class on Thursdays, or do you recommend I switch this class?
Answer: It’s okay to be a few minutes late. We always start 10 minutes after the official start time and end 10 minutes early.

Question: If we are unable to come to Thursday’s class due to illness, are we still able to get the attendance bonus?
Answer: You only need 8 of 12 attendance bonuses, precisely to allow for flexibility.

Question: Just wanted to know how the lecture structure is.
Answer: Lectures are based on the textbook chapter, along with TikToks, discussion prompts, and open-ended questions.

Political Science 1026F/G has no pre-requisites.
Political Science 1025F/G and Political Science 1026F/G are not prerequisites for each other, and can be taken independently of each other and during the same term or many terms apart.
If you are still unsure about the above contact Academic Counselling immediately:
Western Social Science Academic Counselling: https://www.advising.ssc.uwo.ca/
King's Academic Advising : https://www.kings.uwo.ca/about-kings/facts-and-information/administrative-departments/academic-deans-office/
Huron Academic Advising: https://huronu.ca/student-life/student-services/academic-advising/

A: Yes anything that was discussed in the Powerpoints or the videos  

Q: Should we be looking at the green text in the slideshow?  
A: Yes that's largely where the questions are coming from  

Q: To go over in class: key terms and learning outcomes of each lecture.  
A: Each PowerPoint starts with a learning outcome

A: No nothing just in the textbook is examinable it has to be in the Powerpoints or lecture as well

Q: When are final exams?  
A: The registrar sets those dates - we don't have them yet  

Q: Will the answer to a mid term question ever actually be 'this was not discussed in the lecture'
A: yes, these are distractor questions designed to penalise anyone using a chatbot to try and cheat - there isn't any way for the chatbot to know what wasn't discussed in lecture - you have to be in lecture to know that information

Got it — here’s a cleaner version for your MD file, no blanks, no extra formatting:

Q: Are the online lectures the same as in-person lectures?
A: The online lectures serve as the basis for the midterm and final exam (in case someone misses a class), so please be sure to review them.

Q: Are the slides you don’t talk about in class testable?
A: Any slide that appears in the online video is testable, because in case someone misses a class we use the videos as the basis for generating the questions for the midterm and the final.

Q: For the midterm, if a question says “this was not discussed in lecture” but the material was discussed in the textbook, should we still select that option?
A: No questions on the midterm or the final will come directly from the textbook, so you should never choose “this was not discussed in lecture” if it was in the textbook (which is extremely unlikely anyway).
